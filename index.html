                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Jesus Hernandez, I'm 42 years old, I was born and lived in Mexico for 41 years, I currently
                    live in the USA, I've always been passionate about numbers and computing, since I'm born in the 80's
                    I'm a fan of the movies and music of those times, my favorite movies are definitely Back to the
                    future, and Karate Kid, I usually listen to random music in Spanish and English from bands from that
                    time like REO Speedwagon, Scorpions, Caifanes, Soda Estero, Chicago, NSYNC, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    When I was 12 years old I met a computer for the first time in high school, I remember learning to
                    use it and I was fascinated by programming in BASIC and LOGO, at that time I remember that we used
                    3.5 and 5.25 inch floppy disks to load these programs, I also learned to use Microsoft Works, my
                    time in high school was a very important influence for me because it helped me to identify that what
                    I wanted to do as an adult was to program and repair computers, however this lasted only 3 years
                    1992-1995 when I left school I studied repair of computers but did not finish due to economic
                    problems.

                    <p id="continue">
                    Starting in 1998 my life took a different turn for a little over 20 years, because I dedicated
                    myself to accounting and taxes, I put aside that dream I had in high school, in the year 2000 I took
                    a course where I studied the new in computing (office automation) in those years. There I learned
                    Windows 98, basic programs like Excell, Word, PPT, other more interesting ones like web design with
                    HTML and FRONTPAGE, database with FOXPRO, VISUAL FOXPRO and ACCESS, and design with Corel Draw and
                    PHOTODRAW and PUBLISHER.
                    That course taken in 2000 helped me a lot to advance in my career as an accountant, because I
                    applied a lot of this knowledge in the area, transforming much of the work we did manually into a
                    digital and automatic way, it was until 2018 that I decided to return to the world computer science
                    and technology, in that year a couple of events influenced me to make the decision to take a new
                    turn in my life and career, the first was seeing on television a young Mexican at a Canadian
                    University, working for a research project with voice recognition technology, that made me ask
                    myself what I was doing in my life and why I had left the path of computer science, the second was
                    to buy the Elon Musk biography book written by Ashlee Vance, with those two events I decided to get
                    back on track, I have tried to return to university but the education system has not convinced me
                    much, I have learned more these 4 years being self-taught, reading books and taking online courses,
                    and I'm still on the road trying to do something that leaves a mark on this world but above all that
                    makes me feel much more fulfilled, besides that I am passionate about learning and creating new
                    things , I am currently planning to develop solutions for the area of ​​accounting and taxes, as it
                    is something that I have maintained as a freelance working in the US.
